			I've been playing bass for many years, studied Piano to A.B. Grade 8, and played lead guitar in several bands when I still had hair.<br/>
			I have played a variety of other instruments along the way, including most varieties of guitar, 
			things with a piano keyboard, larger stuff made of brass (with valves and slides), a bit of drumming, even the odd saxophone (badly).<br/>
